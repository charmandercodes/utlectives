Furthermore, you will develop skills to design and formulate the piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) of an integrated system of multiple unit operations, and provide justification/assessment of the P&ID based on hazard and operability study, safety life cycle and techno-economic analysis. You will also gain the ability to critically evaluate process designs using hazard identification techniques, assess operability for safe and efficient operation, and perform techno-economic analyses to ensure project feasibility, equipping you to make informed decisions about the process design lifecycle, safety, operability, and economic viability.",
