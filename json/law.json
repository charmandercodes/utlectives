It was established to provide law students with simulated courtroom experience in international law advocacy. This competition simulates a hypothetical dispute between countries and a mock case before the International Court of Justice, the judicial organ of the United Nations. Each year a new hypothetical case, based on complex current issues of public international law, is published. The limited set of facts \u2013 concerning a dispute between the two fictional states appearing before the International Court of Justice \u2013 requires detailed research into both international and comparative law to prepare complex pleadings for both sides. \n\nTeams analyse the problem, conduct detailed legal research, develop legal arguments and prepare written and oral pleadings arguing both the applicant and respondent positions of the case. Teams compete against each other, presenting their submissions which are evaluated by judges based upon advocacy skills and knowledge of international law.\n\nThe Australian national rounds take place in Canberra in February. The top two or three teams qualify to represent their universities at the international rounds in Washington DC each April.\n\nThis subject is demanding and equivalent to a substantial research project.
