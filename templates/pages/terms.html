      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 13/09/2025</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of <strong>utlectives</strong> (the “Platform”), operated by Programmers' Society (“we,” “our,” or “us”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Platform.</p>
      <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> The Platform is an independent student-run initiative and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to UTS or any of its faculties, departments, or staff.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>The Platform is available only to <strong>current students of UTS</strong>. To leave reviews, you must verify your identity by using a valid <code>@uts.edu.au</code> email address. Former students and external users may access reviews but cannot post content.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">3. User-Generated Content</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the reviews, comments, ratings, and any other content (“User Content”) you submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Opinions Only:</strong> User Content represents individual opinions, not verified facts, and not the views of the Platform or its operators.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You must not post content that is defamatory, harassing, false, misleading, or in violation of law or university policy.</li>
        <li><strong>License:</strong> By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, display, and distribute that content in connection with the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> We may, but are not obligated to, monitor, edit, or remove any User Content at our sole discretion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">4. No Liability for Reviews</h2>
      <p>We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, or consequences of any User Content, including reviews or ratings. Users rely on the Platform at their own risk.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All rights in the Platform (excluding User Content) belong to Programmers' Society. Users may not copy, reproduce, or exploit any part of the Platform without our permission.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Privacy & Data</h2>
      <p>We collect minimal data (see our Privacy Policy). Review submission requires verification via a UTS email address. We do not require passwords. While we take reasonable steps to secure data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the unlikely event of a data breach, such as a database of email addresses being leaked, we accept no liability beyond what is required by law.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>You agree not to misuse or disrupt the Platform, attempt unauthorized access, or use the Platform for commercial purposes without consent.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">8. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Programmers' Society, its members, officers, and affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses arising from your use of the Platform, your User Content, or your breach of these Terms.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>The Platform is provided free of charge, and our total liability to you shall not exceed the amount you paid to access it (which is £0).</li>
        <li>We exclude all liability for loss, damage, or harm arising from use of the Platform or from data breaches.</li>
        <li>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">10. No Warranty</h2>
      <p>The Platform is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">11. Suspension & Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Platform at any time, without notice, for conduct that violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
